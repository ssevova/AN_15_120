\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

A search for dark matter produced in association with dark matter is performed on $13\:\TeV$ simulation using the Phys14 MC samples. A cut-and-count analysis is defined, targetting early data for Run-2. A $\met$ shape analysis and a selection involving top-tagging techniques are also defined and show promising potential to improve sensitivity of the search.
