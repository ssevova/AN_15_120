\subsection{Jets}
\label{subsec:obj_jets}

Jets are reconstructed by clustering PF-candidates. The jet collection used in this analysis are clustered with the anti-$k_T$ algorithm with size parameter, $R=0.4$. This jet collection employs charged hadron subtraction (CHS) to reduce pileup contamination. The anti-$k_T$ collection will be denoted as \emph{AK4CHS}. Jets must pass the ``Loose PF Jet ID'' requirements listed in Table~\ref{tab:jetid}.  %Two jet collections are used in this analysis: jets from clustering with the anti-$k_T$ algorithm with size parameter, $R=0.4$, and jets from clustering with the Cambridge-Aachen (CA) algorithm with $R=1.5$. The collection of $R=1.5$ jets are used to tag boosted, hadronically decaying tops by applying jet substructure techniques. Both jet collections employ charged hadron subtraction (CHS) to reduce pileup contamination. The anti-$k_T$ and CA jet collections will be denoted as \emph{AK4CHS} and \emph{CA15CHS} respectively. Jets from either collection must pass the ``Loose PF Jet ID'' requirements listed in Table~\ref{tab:jetid}.

Standard jet energy corrections (JEC), corresponding to the official Run 2 V5 global tag, are applied. %In the case of CA15CHS jets, the JEC for anti-$k_T$ $R=0.8$ jets with CHS are used because this is the largest size parameter with corrections available.

To tag jets that originate from $\Bot$-quarks, the \emph{CSVv2+IVF} discriminator is used with the recommended medium working point. An AK4CHS jet is considered a $\Bot$-jet if $\mbox{CSVv2+IVF} > 0.814$.
