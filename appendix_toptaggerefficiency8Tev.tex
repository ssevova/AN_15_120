\section{8\:\TeV\: Studies}
\label{app:toptaggerefficiency8TeV}

In this Appendix we compare the efficiency and fake rates of the top taggers measured in the 8 TeV data with the ones predicted by the simulations. The same procedure described is Sec. \ref{subsec:sel_toptag_resolved} has been used. An overall good agreement between data and prediction is seen.

The procedure to estimate those quantities has been described in the text. For the few bins where data and the predictions are consistent we noticed that Roofit has not reached convergence. \textcolor{red}{TO BE UNDERSTOOD}}
