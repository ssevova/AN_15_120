Expected upper limits at $95\%$ confidence level on the cross section ratio with respect to $M_*=100\:\GeV$ are computed with the COMBINE tool. For a given $M_\chi$, the EFT is only charaterized by $M_*$, and therefore a lower limit on the interaction mass scale can also be computed. We are also running over simplified models, however the text below is with respect to EFT models. Systematic uncertainties are not yet considered.
