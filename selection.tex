\section{Event Selection}
\label{sec:selection}

Events with signatures consistent with $\ttbar$ production and large $\met$ are selected. An excess in the tails of the $\met$ distribution over SM expectations could indiciate the production of DM particles. Two final states have been studied,
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Hadronic:} jets$+\met$ final state where the $\W$ daughters from the tops decay hadronically,
\item \textbf{Semileptonic:} $\Lep+$jets$+\met$ final state where one of the $\W$ daughters from the tops decay leptonically into a muon or electron and neutrino.
\end{itemize}

%Recent developments in jet substructure have established effective techniques for identifying highly boosted $\Top$ quarks that decay hadronically such that all decay products fall within a single jet. This allows definitions of signal region categories with higher purity in the kinematic regime of boosted tops. Therefore, two general selection strategies are presented:
Two exclusive categories are presented:
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Inclusive:} a single signal category that does not target any kinematic region in particular.
\item \textbf{Top-tagged:} the signal region is comprised of resolved top tags.%divided into several categories based on the number of boosted top tags.
\end{itemize}
