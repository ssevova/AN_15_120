\subsection{Inclusive Selection: Hadronic channel}
\label{subsec:sel_incl_hadronic}
%\textcolor{red}{To be updated from Phys14 to Spring15 studies before full stats}
Events for the hadronic channel are obtained with two triggers. For events from runs before 254227, the trigger used is HLT\_PFMET170\_NoiseCleaned\_PFMHTNoMu120\_IDTight, while for subsequent runs, the trigger is HLT\_PFMETNoMu120\_JetIdCleaned\_PFMHTNoMu120\_IDTight. The efficiency of these triggers with respect to offline $\met$ in the single electron and single muon channels is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:meteff_0}. Discrepancies in the turn-on curves between the two channels are under investigation. Overall efficiencies at the plateau in both channels are in agreement between data and MC (comparing the fit parameter $\epsilon_{0}$ and the fit).This dictates the use of a unity scale factor for data-to-MC $\met$ corrections.

The offline event selection requires,
\begin{itemize}
\item $\met > 250\:\GeV$, to be on the plateau of the efficiency turn-on curve,
\item at least $4$ AK4CHS jets with $\pt>30\:\GeV$ and $|\eta|<4$,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item at least $2$ of which have $|\eta|<2.4$ and $\Bot$-tagged,
  \end{itemize}
\item no muons passing ``Loose'' selection with $\pt>10\:\GeV$ and $|\eta|<2.4$,
\item no electrons passing ``Veto'' selection with $\pt>10\:\GeV$ and $|\eta|<2.5$,
\item $\min_{i=1,\ldots,6}\Delta\phi\left(j_i,\met\right)>1$, the minimum $\Delta\phi$ between jet and $\met$ considering up to the sixth leading jet.
\end{itemize}

The $\min_{i=1,\ldots,6}\Delta\phi\left(j_i,\met\right)$ distribution after all other selection cuts is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dphijetmet6}. The cut on this variable reduces the QCD multi-jets background to negligible levels. It also reduces the $\ttbar$ background, which is predominantly semileptonic.%, because events with high $\met$ have a boosted $\Top$ quark and therefore the neutrino and $\Bot$ jet will be close to each other. 
It was studied that considering $\Delta\phi$ for up to the sixth leading jet performs better than considering fewer number of jets and better than considering all jets. These studies are presented in Appendix~\ref{app:dphijetmet}.
