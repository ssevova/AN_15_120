\section{Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{sec:systematics}

For backgrounds estimated by applying data/MC corrections derived from the control regions, the systematic uncertainty comes from the statistical uncertainty in the control regions as well as any systematic difference in extrapolating from the control region to the signal region (e.g. modeling $\Zjets$ with $\gamma+$jets). For the signal and backgrounds estimated purely with MC, the main sources of systematic uncertainties are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Parton distribution function: evalulated by computing the change in yiels or shape from the error sets provided by the PDF set.
\item Missing higher order terms: evaluated by the usual procedure of varying the QCD factorization and renormalization scale together by a factor of $0.5$ and by a factor of $2$, and compute the change in yields or shape.
\item Efficiencies: uncertainty on the various data/MC efficiency scale factors used to correct the MC:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item trigger
  \item lepton selection
  \item $\Bot$-tagging
  \item top-tagging (category migration effects)
  \end{itemize}
\item $\met$ scale and resolution
\item Jet energy scale and resolution
\item Luminosity
\end{itemize}
